# Hello World Repository

A first GitHub repository.

Nothing much to see here!

Using this repoistory to store some of my favorite settings, commands, and scripts for quick setup on new machines.

## `bin`

Contains files I ususally create/place in `$HOME/bin`.

## `dotfiles`

Contains `.vimrc` file for customizing the `vim` text editor.  (This config file is a work in progress.)

## Cool Text Only Stuff

Resize Terminal Font.  (Tried on Ubuntu 16.04.2 Desktop.)  Found on StackOverflow.

```bash
setfont /usr/share/consolefonts/Lat7-Terminus28x14.psf.gz
```

Change `Caps Lock` to an extra `Ctrl` key.  (Only works in X.)  Temporary.  Using `Alt`+`F1` then `Alt`+`F7` will reset.

```bash
setxkbmap -option ctrl:nocaps
```
